# CS229 Spring 2020

## Introduction

This repo records my answer to the problem sets of CS229 Spring 2020. Only the **coding part** is presented here. Please refer to [this post](https://terryli710.github.io/2020/06/28/cs229/) for the questions and the theory part.

## Usage

Codes are under the **`src`** files for each problem set. 

E.g. in PS1, question 1, (b), the question reffers to `src/linearclass/logreg.py`. So the answers can be found at

`terryli710/CS229/ps1/src/linearclass/logreg.py`

The `tex` files contain the LaTeX templates for problem sets.

## Questions

These are all my answers, thus are not perfect. If you spot any mistakes, you can either [raise an issue](https://github.com/terryli710/CS229/issues/new) or [email me](li.terry710@gmail.com) to discuss with me.
